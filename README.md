# employees-list-item-component

Explanation:
Imports: The code starts by importing the necessary CSS styles for the component, keeping the styles modular and encapsulated.

EmployeesListItem Component: The EmployeesListItem functional component receives several props from its parent component.

Destructuring Props: The relevant properties are destructured from the props object for easier access and cleaner code.

Dynamic Class Names: A base class name is initialized for the list item. Conditional classes are appended based on the increase and rise props, allowing for dynamic styling.

Rendering JSX:

The list item (li) uses the dynamically generated class names.
The name (span) triggers onToggleProp when clicked, passing the rise data-toggle attribute.
The salary input field displays the salary with a $ sign and updates the salary state when it loses focus (onBlur event).
Buttons for toggling the increase state and deleting the item call their respective handlers (onToggleProp and onDelete) and display appropriate icons.
A static star icon is included for visual enhancement.
Export: The component is exported as the default export, making it available for import in other files.
